                Topic sentences are similar to mini thesis statements. Like a thesis statement, 
                a topic sentence has a specific main point. 
                Whereas the thesis is the main point of the essay, 
                the topic sentence is the main point of the paragraph. 
                Like the thesis statement, a topic sentence has a unifying function. 
                But a thesis statement or topic sentence alone doesn’t guarantee unity. 
                An essay is unified if all the paragraphs relate to the thesis, 
                whereas a paragraph is unified if all the sentences relate to the topic sentence. 
                Note: Not all paragraphs need topic sentences. I
                n particular, opening and closing paragraphs, which serve different functions from body paragraphs, 
                generally don’t have topic sentences.
