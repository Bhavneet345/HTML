        <h1>PRE-REQUISITES</h1>
        <p>This is easily the most important step of all. In absence of these, a code may be inefficient even if it is completed. 
            The prerequisites that need to be in place for an efficient code covers matters like design and architecture. An important question is how development is structured. What is the specific purpose of the software? The problem that the code is meant to solve must be clear to the developer. What is the design of the individual components? Such basic requirements have to be fulfilled when a good code is being written.
            Hoare makes a good point when it comes to assessing software design and architecture. 
            Either a code is so simple that there are obviously no errors, or a code is so complex that there are no obvious errors.
            Software design is also of importance to clients, who can decide if their needs are being adequately addressed. If there are some things that architecture cannot take care of, then those are handled in the software design phase. A detailed design is a good guide for coding
            The next step is to measure existing programming languages against the requirements to decide on an appropriate one. If needed, a mixed routine can be adopted.
            Once these are met, it becomes easier to follow some established good coding practices.</p>
